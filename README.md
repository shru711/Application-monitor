# Application-monitor
Detects and terminates unauthorised applications.
Real time monitoring of systems to prevent inappropriate activities, that are irrelevant to the course, especially during laboratory sessions is essential. Moreover, minimising the idle time of the systems that results in excessive power loss, contributes towards green computing. Overall enhancement of the implementation of a given task that is being performed by the students is equally important. 
This project presents a solution which is a software application that not only monitors the activity of the students constantly but also terminates unnecessary applications dynamically. 
It also keeps track of CPU utilisation to put idle systems to sleep, in turn mitigating unnecessary power consumption. 
It is built on a client-server architecture with the help of socket programming. 
Screenshots and logs of the clientsâ€™ system are sent to the teachers on demand. 
This real time software hence aids in more efficient teacher-student interaction, better implementation of the task, increasing lab productivity and contributing towards green computing.
